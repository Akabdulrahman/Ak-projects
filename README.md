# Project Churn(Credit Card customers)
 A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction. 
Therfore, in this project, i analyzed and predict customers who are going to get churned and provide recommendations so as to provide better services as wella as turning customer's decision to the opposite direction
